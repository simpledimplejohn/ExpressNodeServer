# __Practicing Express Server__

### __Description__
This is my first server, a very simple bare bones setup that I can reference later when setting up other servers or if I need something quick.

### Installation Instructions
To set up Express from scratch do the following:
1. Create a root folder and navigate into it.
2. Run `npm init`
3. Run `npm install express`
4. Create a .gitignore file with `node_modules` in it
