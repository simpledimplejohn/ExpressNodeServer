# __Practicing Express Server__

### __Description__
This is my first server, a very simple bare bones setup that I can reference later when setting up other servers or if I need something quick.

### __Building This From Scratch__
To set up Express from scratch do the following:
1. Create a root folder and navigate into it.
2. Run `npm init`
3. Run `npm install express`
4. Create a .gitignore file with `node_modules` in it
5. Run `npm install nedb` to install the database

### __Run instructions__

1. Download repo
2. Navigate to Root folder
3. In terminal run: `node index.js`
4. Open `localhost:3000` in your browser
5. To test the server:
    - Local longitude and latitude should print in the dom
    - response should print in the terminal
